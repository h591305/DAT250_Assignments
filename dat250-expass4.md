## The Database
- The database is run which was used in this project is a H2 database. The database is set up and run when the application starts. The `persistence.xml` contains the necessary code for Hibernate to control the database interactions through SQL-queries.
- I will link the SQL code that Hibernate used to create the database:
- Customer was created by using this SQL-code:

  ```sql

    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
 
    create table Customer_Address (
        Customer_id bigint not null,
        addresses_id bigint not null
    )

    create table Customer_CreditCard (
        Customer_id bigint not null,
        creditCards_id bigint not null
    )

  ```
- To inspect the database tables I changed the property of hibernate.show_sql to true in the persistence file.
  ```xml
  <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/>
  ```
- The database was structured as I intended in the first place.
