# RabbitMQ Experiment

## Introduction
For this experiment I will use RabbitMQ to learn about message queues. I will use Java/Maven to complete the RabbitMQ tutorial.

## Technical Issues
For this experiment I created the project as a Java/Gradle-project. Then the program did not compile, even though I had added the libraries correct.
After some time I decided to switch to a Java/Maven-project. That fixed the problem of the program not compiling.
