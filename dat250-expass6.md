### Oblig_3 report:

### Installation
I did not have any problems with installing npm/node and creating the project.

### Summary:
For this assignment I did get to set up a single-page application. But due to illness, I did not manage to do too much on it.
I did manage to fetch data from the backend and post data to the backend, hence the sign-up page. The rest was just to experiment with the framework.
For the next assignment I will clean up the code, and make it a more functional application.
